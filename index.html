<p1>Hello Zonny. This is the virtual me tryna talk to you through website coding just to tell you that even though I chose not to talk to you so that you can find peace I really miss you Akinyi. Walai for sure I dont know how or why but a day never passes by without me thinking of you. Not any girl I ever attached myself to this way. Yea I do know that sometimes I did misbehave and every sort of thing that happened before hurting either you or I it doesn't matter to me again. Zonny I do know that you know I love you and that fact really stands till today, 2nd feb 2026, just weeks before you come for mid term break. The memories, your smile, just everything about you makes me get lost deep in thoughts. Knowing that you're also projecting to do medicine like me I do know that you need time to study, si kama mimi I multi tasked at that time. I miss you Zonny! I will love you to the moon and back miss. Unacheki hii doba inaitwa 'malaika' by nyashinski suites how I see you love. I love you Zonny. The song by vijana barubaru still lingers in me and mean a lot when I just listen to it. your pics and everything about you be it memories makes me at ease when I think about you. Check this out!</p1>
